# Mjolnirsoft Design Record

This document describes **what the project currently does and why** — shipped reality, not aspiration. Proposed and in-progress design lives in open GitHub issues ("design candidates"); language only lands here once the issue that introduced it has closed. See *Design Documentation* in `CLAUDE.md` for the methodology.

Organised by subsystem. When a component does not yet exist, it does not yet appear here.

## Project foundation & tooling

**What it does.** The repository is a TypeScript/Node project. Tests run on [vitest](https://vitest.dev) via `npm test`; `npm run typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit`. A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the typecheck and the test suite on every push and pull request. Machine-specific configuration is kept out of source via the gitignored `.local.env` convention.

**Why.** The orchestration tooling coordinates Claude Code sessions; Claude Code is itself a Node CLI and the Claude Agent SDK ships for TypeScript, so building in the same ecosystem minimises impedance — and the dominant future host-integration surface (VS Code extensions) is TypeScript regardless. vitest was chosen for native TypeScript execution without a separate compile step. CI runs the suite on every push because the project's testing discipline requires tests to pass in CI before an issue closes; wiring it once makes that enforceable rather than aspirational.

_No further subsystems are implemented yet. The orchestration core and its shared-channel protocol are proposed design candidates tracked in open issues, and will be recorded here as they ship._
